# Java Functional and Iterative Functions with JUnit Testing
This README file provides an overview of functional and iterative functions I created using Java. The functions are organized into separate directories, each containing variant approaches for the same target. All functions are tested using JUnit Testing.

## CountingDuplicates
The CountingDuplicates directory contains variant approaches to a function that counts the number of times a character appears in a string. Each approach uses a different method for counting the duplicates. The functions are named countDuplicates, countDuplicatesUsingMap, and countDuplicatesUsingStream.

## Digits_Only
The Digits_Only directory contains variant approaches to a function that checks if a string contains only digits. Each approach uses a different method for checking if the string contains only digits. The functions are named containsDigitsOnly, containsDigitsOnlyRegex, and containsDigitsOnlyStream.

## Generate_Permutations
The Generate_Permutations directory contains variant approaches to a function that generates all possible permutations of a given string. Each approach uses a different algorithm for generating the permutations. The functions are named generatePermutations, generatePermutationsUsingHeap, and generatePermutationsUsingRecursive.

## No_Repeats
The No_Repeats directory contains variant approaches to a function that checks if a string has no repeating characters. Each approach uses a different method for checking if the string has no repeating characters. The functions are named hasNoRepeatingChars, hasNoRepeatingCharsUsingArray, and hasNoRepeatingCharsUsingSet.

## Occurrences_Char
The Occurrences_Char directory contains variant approaches to a function that counts the number of occurrences of a character in a string. Each approach uses a different method for counting the occurrences. The functions are named countCharOccurrences, countCharOccurrencesUsingRegex, and countCharOccurrencesUsingStream.

## Palindrome_Checker
The Palindrome_Checker directory contains variant approaches to a function that checks if a string is a palindrome. Each approach uses a different method for checking if the string is a palindrome. The functions are named isPalindrome, isPalindromeUsingStringBuilder, and isPalindromeUsingStream.

## Reverse_String
The Reverse_String directory contains variant approaches to a function that reverses a string. Each approach uses a different method for reversing the string. The functions are named reverseString, reverseStringUsingStringBuilder, and reverseStringUsingStack.

## Conclusion
These functional and iterative functions provide different solutions for various programming problems. By creating and implementing these functions, I was able to improve my understanding of Java programming concepts such as string manipulation, recursion, and data structures. The JUnit testing ensures that the functions work as expected and helps to identify any potential errors. By organizing the functions into separate directories, I can easily compare and contrast different approaches and choose the one that best fits my needs.
